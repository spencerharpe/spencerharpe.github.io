#### Overview

I use the term *educational scholarship* broadly here to encompass the scholarship of assessment, learning, and teaching and more traditional educational research activities. In addition to maintaining active scholarship in this area, I have also been involved in efforts to promote the development of these skills among others health professions faculty. The current lines of inquiry I have in this area are described here.

#### Areas of inquiry

*Research and evaluation skills in health professions education*
Understanding research and evaluation methods is important in this era of evidence-based practice. These skills are considered integral parts of many professional program curricula. Despite their inclusion, the nature in which these topics are discussed and the expected learning outcomes surrounding these skills (e.g., information consumer vs. information producer) appear to vary widely across professional degree programs. These skills are important from the perspective of evaluating the outcomes of practice activities, which can be vital to advancing practice, optimizing patient care, and improving patient and population outcomes.

*Engagement in research and evaluation* 
Incorporating research and evaluation skills into health professions curricula is an important step. It is also important to ensure our professional degree programs and postgraduate training programs help learners develop the interest, confidence, and competence to engage in research and evaluation in their professional careers. This can be an important way to help bridge the gap between research and practice.  Having served as a research mentor to postgraduate trainees and graduate students for many years, I am keenly interested in ways to facilitate future engagement in research and evaluation among health professionals. 

*Diversity, equity, and inclusion in curricula and education scholarship*
As health professions educators, we want to ensure that future health professions are ready to provide inclusive care to diverse populations and promote health equity. This requires that these topics be addressed in curricula. For PharmD programs, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education 2016 accreditation standards include cultural sensitivity as a key element of Standard 3 (Approach to patient care). I have collaborated with clinical faculty to examine the inclusion of gender- and sex-related differences in PharmD curricula.  I have also worked with a group of investigators from pharmacy programs around the US to develop the Self-Assessment of Perceived Level of Cultural Competence (SAPLCC), a measure of cultural sensitivity that incorporates several important domains when providing culturally appropriate care. More recently, colleagues and I published a critical review of considerations when collecting demographic data so that key elements of diversity and inclusion are reflected.
