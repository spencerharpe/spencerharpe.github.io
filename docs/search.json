    "text": "Approach to scholarship\nFrom a research methods standpoint, I typically draw on approaches from the epidemiological or sociobehavioral traditions. I also have a strong background in quantitative statistical methods. Given my focus on methods and analysis, I am often asked to join research projects as a collaborator bringing expertise in methods and analysis. Collaboration is important to me as a researcher because it promotes diversity in thought and method. This can produce stronger studies and maintain a high level of applicability to education and practice. I think it is important to consider why a particular research approach is being used and whether that is the most appropriate keeping in mind that there may be options worth considering that are more commonly used outside the health professions (e.g., education, social work, business). When I collaborate with others, this is the perspective I try to bring to the research endeavor. Although I am not currently a practicing pharmacist, I have been able to draw on my clinical training and previous practice experience to work effectively with faculty who are primarily practice-focused by bridging the gap between some of the seemingly esoteric, but very important, issues associated with conducting research and the practical relevance of the project at hand. Ensuring applicability to education and practice has always been an important consideration in my scholarship efforts. In fact, I think that certain types of educational scholarship can be viewed as a form of practice-based research. The motivation for many of my projects are frequently rooted in my experiences as an educator, a researcher, and even my service as an editor. This allows me to keep the practical application front and center when designing projects."

    "text": "Areas of inquiry\n\nResearch and evaluation skills in health professions education Understanding research and evaluation methods is important in this era of evidence-based practice. These skills are considered integral parts of many professional program curricula. Despite their inclusion, the nature in which these topics are discussed and the expected learning outcomes surrounding these skills (e.g., information consumer vs. information producer) appear to vary widely across professional degree programs. These skills are important from the perspective of evaluating the outcomes of practice activities, which can be vital to advancing practice, optimizing patient care, and improving patient and population outcomes.\nEngagement in research and evaluation  Incorporating research and evaluation skills into health professions curricula is an important step. It is also important to ensure our professional degree programs and postgraduate training programs help learners develop the interest, confidence, and competence to engage in research and evaluation in their professional careers. This can be an important way to help bridge the gap between research and practice. Having served as a research mentor to postgraduate trainees and graduate students for many years, I am keenly interested in ways to facilitate future engagement in research and evaluation among health professionals.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion in curricula and education scholarship As health professions educators, we want to ensure that future health professions are ready to provide inclusive care to diverse populations and promote health equity. This requires that these topics be addressed in curricula. For PharmD programs, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education 2016 accreditation standards include cultural sensitivity as a key element of Standard 3 (Approach to patient care). I have collaborated with clinical faculty to examine the inclusion of gender- and sex-related differences in PharmD curricula. I have also worked with a group of investigators from pharmacy programs around the US to develop the Self-Assessment of Perceived Level of Cultural Competence (SAPLCC), a measure of cultural sensitivity that incorporates several important domains when providing culturally appropriate care. More recently, colleagues and I published a critical review of considerations when collecting demographic data so that key elements of diversity and inclusion are reflected.\nCurriculum management through the lenses of implementation science, improvement science and program evaluation Having been through many different curricular revisions and seen curriculum management approaches in several health professions I have long wondered why we do not do a better job of incorporating best practices from areas like implementation science, improvement science, or program evaluation in curriculum development and management. My recent experience going through multiple curricular revisions in short order, serving as curriculum committee chair for two of those, has reinforced my questions in this area. If these topics are important enough to incorporate into our curricula, then we should use them in our work related to the curriculum itself. From program evaluation, one could ask why explicit logic models are not constructed to guide the curriculum, especially programmatic assessment. Improvement science has demonstrated the importance of taking a systematic approach to change and collecting data to guide improvement (e.g., using data dashboards to track achievement of outcomes or levels of entrustment for entrustable professional activities). Successful quality improvement efforts have also identified the importance of incorporating the mindset of quality improvement into day-to-day work of all individuals within an organization, not just those who are “in charge” of quality. For health professions education, it is important for all faculty to know how they contribute to program quality. This is not something that is only the responsibility of assessment directors. Admittedly, there are some programs that have done a better job than others, but it these seem to be more isolated than widespread, at least in pharmacy. In my experience, there is not much discussion and collaboration across professions. This is despite our efforts to increase interprofessional education. In the future, I want to examine those programs that have made efforts to incorporate principles of from these areas when managing their curricula and identify ways to facilitate incorporation of these principles more broadly.\nAssessment processes supporting student learning Assessment is a key component of any educational program. Developing an effective culture assessment can help emphasize the value of continuous assessment processes, whether formal assessments or informal or even self-assessment by students. My interests in this area include student self-assessment practices and authenticity in assessment procedures."

    "text": "Lines of Inquiry\n\nOpen science practices in the health professions  There has been an expanding body of work examining open science attitudes and practices among researchers in various fields. The health professions have not been a focus of this existing work. There is an understandable tension between the movement to make science more openly available and the perceived need for biomedical research to be somewhat closed and protected from the perspective of protecting patients from undue harm resulting from the use of therapies described in papers that have yet to be peer reviewed. I recently finished collecting data on open science practices and attitudes among pharmacy faculty in the US and analysis is beginning. My goal is to expand on this work by including a broader range of health professions and to examine open science practices in health professions education scholars.\nReviewing and publishing patterns Peer review is a cornerstone of the current scientific publishing process. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, many journals experienced an increase in the number of submissions without a subsequent increase in the number of reviewers. If anything, reviewers were sometimes harder to find, especially for journals seeking reviews from current practitioners. Anecdotally, pharmacy seems to have drawn from a similar pool of reviewers. This is no doubt similar in other health professions. For this project, I have obtained the reviewers for 12 pharmacy journals and will be conducting network analysis to examine how closely related the journals are through their reviewers. A similar issue is individuals who submit papers to journals for review but do not serve as reviewers themselves. As an editor, I have access to the reviewers and submitters. I am currently in the process of obtaining approval from different pharmacy journals to obtain data to compare patterns of reviewers and submitters. Assuming I can get other pharmacy journals to join, this could be the starting point of future scholarly efforts in pharmacy publishing by connecting the different journals. Ideally, I would like to expand these projects to other health professions\nRegistration of studies of pharmacy care services Registration of studies can promote research transparency and accountability. Federal law requires registration and reporting of results from FDA-regulated trials and federally sponsored research in study registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Registration of trials prior to subject enrollment has been required by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors since 2005. I have published an initial study in this area examining the prevalence and type of studies of pharmacy care services found in ClinicalTrials.gov. The next steps in this area involve describing the prevalence of pre-registered studies in pharmacy journals and examining why these studies are not registered.\nQuality of survey research Survey methods are not an uncommon research approach, especially in pharmacy research. One common concern in survey research is response rates, which have been shown to be on the decline. A historical review of survey-based research published in pharmacy journals between 1988 and 2018 was conducted to examine the types of survey methods used, application of best practices, reported response rate, and characteristics of groups being surveyed. Preliminary analysis of 2018 data were presented at the American Pharmacists Association 2022 Annual Meeting. Additional data collection is planned to include studies published in 2023 and then analysis across all years will be conducted to examine predictors of response rates."

    "text": "Being a diverse area of study, medication use research may look at issues affecting individual patients or issues at the larger organizational or healthcare system level. As mentioned previously, my scholarship efforts have shifted over time such that this is not a major area of focus. I continue to maintain some level of involvement primarily through collaboration with clinicians and mentoring students or postgraduate trainees. My past work in this area has included a range of topics including medication adherence, medication safety, outcomes of medication use, evaluation of medication use processes, and developing methods to support research in this area. The main ongoing project I have in this area is a Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs grant from SAMHSA to the State of Illinois where I am the project evaluator. This five-year $1.92 million grant is focused on developing educational programs to improve opioid prescribing by healthcare providers and prevent opioid use and misuse among emerging adults."
