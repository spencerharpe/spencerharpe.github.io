    "text": "I am a professor of pharmacy administration at Midwestern University College of Pharmacy in Downers Grove, Illinois. My primary teaching responsibilities include topics related healthcare quality, program evaluation in healthcare, and quality improvement. My scholarly interests involve health professions education, meta-research, and medication use research. Outside of my primary position, I also serve as an editor for the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association and Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning.\nI completed my pharmacy education at the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy. After pharmacy school, I pursued graduate studies at the Ohio State University College of Pharmacy and College of Public Health. During graduate school, I practiced as a hospital pharmacist at OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\nThe links at the top of the page provide more information about me.

    "text": "Approach to scholarship\nFrom a research methods standpoint, I typically draw on approaches from the epidemiological or sociobehavioral traditions. I also have a strong background in quantitative statistical methods. Given my focus on methods and analysis, I am often asked to join research projects as a collaborator bringing expertise in methods and analysis. Collaboration is important to me as a researcher because it promotes diversity in thought and method. This can produce stronger studies and maintain a high level of applicability to education and practice. I think it is important to consider why a particular research approach is being used and whether that is the most appropriate keeping in mind that there may be options worth considering that are more commonly used outside the health professions (e.g., education, social work, business). When I collaborate with others, this is the perspective I try to bring to the research endeavor. Although I am not currently a practicing pharmacist, I have been able to draw on my clinical training and previous practice experience to work effectively with faculty who are primarily practice-focused by bridging the gap between some of the seemingly esoteric, but very important, issues associated with conducting research and the practical relevance of the project at hand. Ensuring applicability to education and practice has always been an important consideration in my scholarship efforts. In fact, I think that certain types of educational scholarship can be viewed as a form of practice-based research. The motivation for many of my projects are frequently rooted in my experiences as an educator, a researcher, and even my service as an editor. This allows me to keep the practical application front and center when designing projects."

    "text": "Areas of inquiry\nResearch and evaluation skills in health professions education Understanding research and evaluation methods is important in this era of evidence-based practice. These skills are considered integral parts of many professional program curricula. Despite their inclusion, the nature in which these topics are discussed and the expected learning outcomes surrounding these skills (e.g., information consumer vs. information producer) appear to vary widely across professional degree programs. These skills are important from the perspective of evaluating the outcomes of practice activities, which can be vital to advancing practice, optimizing patient care, and improving patient and population outcomes.\nEngagement in research and evaluation Incorporating research and evaluation skills into health professions curricula is an important step. It is also important to ensure our professional degree programs and postgraduate training programs help learners develop the interest, confidence, and competence to engage in research and evaluation in their professional careers. This can be an important way to help bridge the gap between research and practice. Having served as a research mentor to postgraduate trainees and graduate students for many years, I am keenly interested in ways to facilitate future engagement in research and evaluation among health professionals.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion in curricula and education scholarship As health professions educators, we want to ensure that future health professions are ready to provide inclusive care to diverse populations and promote health equity. This requires that these topics be addressed in curricula. For PharmD programs, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education 2016 accreditation standards include cultural sensitivity as a key element of Standard 3 (Approach to patient care). I have collaborated with clinical faculty to examine the inclusion of gender- and sex-related differences in PharmD curricula. I have also worked with a group of investigators from pharmacy programs around the US to develop the Self-Assessment of Perceived Level of Cultural Competence (SAPLCC), a measure of cultural sensitivity that incorporates several important domains when providing culturally appropriate care. More recently, colleagues and I published a critical review of considerations when collecting demographic data so that key elements of diversity and inclusion are reflected."
