## Greetings and welcome! :wave:

I am a professor of pharmacy administration at Midwestern University College of Pharmacy in Downers Grove, Illinois. My primary teaching responsibilities include topics related healthcare quality, program evaluation in healthcare, and quality improvement. My scholarly interests involve health professions education, meta-research, and medication use research. Outside of my primary position, I also serve as an editor for the [*Journal of the American Pharmacists Association*](https://www.japha.org) and [*Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/currents-in-pharmacy-teaching-and-learning).

I completed my pharmacy education at the [University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.olemiss.edu/). After pharmacy school, I pursued graduate studies at the [Ohio State University College of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.osu.edu/) and [College of Public Health](https://cph.osu.edu/). During graduate school, I practiced as a hospital pharmacist at OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.
