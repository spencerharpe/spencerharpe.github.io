## Greetings! :wave:

Welcome to my professional corner of the internet. I am a professor of pharmacy administration at Midwestern University College of Pharmacy in Downers Grove, Illinois. My primary teaching responsibilities include quality improvement and program evaluation in healthcare. My scholarly interests include health professions education, meta-research, and medication use research. Outside of my primary position, I also serve as an editor for the *Journal of the American Pharmacists Association* and *Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning*. 

I completed my pharmacy education at the University of Mississippi. After pharmacy school, I pursued graduate studies in pharmacy administration (aka, social and administrative pharmacy) and public health at Ohio State University. During graduate school, I practiced as a hospital pharmacist at OhioHealth Riverside  Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

The links at the top of the page provide more information about me. Please click around the site. If you have any questions, just send me an email or contact me through social media.
